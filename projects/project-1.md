In ICS 212 I learned to code in C and C++. The class was online so keeping up the with weekly readings and assignments were self directed. Theis final project was made in C++ with JGRASP. It has three classes and a main. The Person class creates an object with two strings, name and campus. The student and staff classes use the object created in the Person class and add on strings specific to the class (i.e. major for students and department for staff). 

I really liked this class because it was completely self directed. The information needed to construct the code was covered in the reading.
I like this project because it reminds me that I can create working code that I am proud of.
