The Library is a final project created in a group for ICS 211. It is a multi-class java program that uses a menu to add, sell, and create books. The library is stored in a BTS (binary search tree) with each book being represented as an object comprised of a string, name, and number, ISBN. 

This was the first group project I've ever been apart of for an ICS class. It taught me about working together and coding together while utilizing the skills of the individual. The valuable time working face-to-face and bouncing ideas off one another showed me how differntly people think and how to intergrate those ideas together rather than selecting just one.
