    The time I spent this past week on FreeCodeCamp was not my first time with Javascript. 
    During the summer of 2013 I used CodeAcademy to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript so I could build a website for my school’s robotics team.
    I never built the site, though I finished the lessons.
    More recently I took ICS 215, Introduction to Scripting, last semester at Leeward Community College where I was introduced to the basics of Perl, and Python, and reaquainted with Javascript. 
    During the first week of this class I retained and implemented more Javascript than I had during the entire semester of 215. 
    I learned what let and const were and how to use them and I learned how to create arrays and objects in Javascript.
   
   As a tool for a web developer, I think Javascript is a good programming language. 
   It allows websites to be more dynamic and unique while being easy to learn and rigidly flexible in its structure. 
   Beyond its web capabilities I don’t see how Javascript can be used. So it’s good for what it does and outside of that it just is. 
    
    I find the practice WODs humbling and frustrating. 
    Receiving DNF's on the two real WODs reiterated an old nemesis of mine, failure, or rather the fear of it. 
    I realized how much I hated that feeling, especially when I began so confidant in my knowledge of Javascript and understanding of the task. 
    I have come to see that while WODs are stressful, they push me to be more diligent and thorough when preparing for the coming week and the coming WOD. 
    In time,  I think I can make WODs work for me.
