Using JSFiddle to code javascript is the worst. Why? Simply because of the error checking process. If a bracket, parenthesis, etc is missing its other half the only indication comes when you run the code and are returned “Expected ';' . ”The process of finding and correcting that grouping indicator could take so very long a time depending on the length of the code. The prolonged time between error and correction negates the learning ability of the error because so much time has passed. Instead all the remains is frustration, at yourself for making such a minor infraction and spending so much time fixing it and at JSFiddle for not having a way to identify the error. 
ESLint with IntelliJ lets  the creator know in real time the line of the error, what the infraction is, and explains what the infraction is. It does become irritating when those colored lines begin to amass, staring at you, telling you, reminding you of your mistakes. Knowledge, however, is power and I would rather have the overabundance of information than attempt to persevere in the wake of its absence. 
The use of coding standards helps improve the readability of code and helps beginners learn code. The main way coding standards improves readability is in the formatting of functions. The start of a new function always begins indented on a new line with its contents indented once more and left aligned below. This style is unusual to become  accustomed to for anyone whose coded without, however it does greatly help in reading code by defining a solid, box like structure of each function. Secondly, though this might just be a personal quirk, but I learn better with well defined structure and rules. Reading and understanding rules allows for a better understanding of the structure, the format of how things should be. When beginning to code it is overwhelming because of the complexity and vastness of any coding language, so having that understanding before putting fingers to keys helps in learning.
